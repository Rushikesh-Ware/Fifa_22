This selection was intended to balance the analysis across historically successful clubs and other significant but perhaps less dominant teams, providing a broader perspective on wage distribution across different levels of club success and popularity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop_leagues_players <- Fifa_22 %>%\n  filter(league_name %in% c(\"English Premier League\", \"Spain Primera Division\", \n                            \"German 1. Bundesliga\", \"French Ligue 1\", \"Italian Serie A\"))\n\n# Randomly select 5 teams from each league\nset.seed(123)  # Setting seed for reproducibility\nselected_teams_dataset <- top_leagues_players %>%\n  group_by(league_name) %>%\n  group_modify(~ .x %>% slice_sample(n = min(5, n_distinct(.x$club_name))))\n\n# Check the selected teams\nprint(selected_teams_dataset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate average salary per team grouped by league\naverage_salary_per_team <- selected_teams_dataset %>%\n  group_by(league_name, club_name) %>%\n  summarise(average_wage = mean(wage_eur, na.rm = TRUE),\n            wage_sd = sd(wage_eur, na.rm = TRUE),\n            min_wage = min(wage_eur, na.rm = TRUE),\n            max_wage = max(wage_eur, na.rm = TRUE),\n            count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n```\n:::\n\n\n### **Statistical Analysis**\n\n#### **ANOVA Results**\n\nFollowing the data preparation, a two-way ANOVA was conducted to assess the effects of 'league_name' and 'club_name' on the wages of the players:\n\n-   **League Effect**: With a p-value of 0.0509, the influence of the league on player wages is marginally significant, suggesting variations in wage structures across leagues.\n\n-   **Club Effect**: The club impact, with a p-value of 0.0690, indicates variability in wages that also depends significantly on the club, though this effect is slightly less pronounced than that of the league.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    anova_result <- aov(wage_eur ~ league_name + club_name, data = selected_teams_dataset)\n    summary(anova_result)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n#### **Regression Model Analysis**\n\nTo further quantify the influence of league and club on wages, a linear regression model was applied:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregression_model <- lm(wage_eur ~ league_name + club_name, data = selected_teams_dataset)\nsummary(regression_model)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis model provides coefficients that quantify how much each league and each club contribute to the wage structure, beyond the categorical group effects tested by the ANOVA. Key results include:\n\n-   **League Contributions**: Different leagues have different base salary levels, with coefficients indicating how much above or below the average league wage each league tends to pay.\n\n-   **Club Contributions**: Clubs also show significant variability, with some paying substantially more or less than the league average, reflecting their financial strategies and market positioning.\n\n#### **Visual Analysis of Wage Distribution**\n\n##### **Average Salary by Team and League**\n\nThis visualization reflects the average salary distribution by team within each selected league, illustrating the diversity of wage scales:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(average_salary_per_team, aes(x = reorder(club_name, -average_wage), y = average_wage, fill = league_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary by Team and League\", x = \"Team\", y = \"Average Salary (EUR)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](avg salary.png)\n\n##### **Detailed Wage Distribution by Team and League**\n\nFurther detailed analysis of wage distribution by team and league highlights the spread and outliers, providing deeper insights into each teamâ€™s wage policy:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(average_salary_per_team, aes(x = club_name, y = average_wage, fill = league_name)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = average_wage - wage_sd, ymax = average_wage + wage_sd), width = 0.4) +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flips the axes for better visualization of team names\n  labs(title = \"Detailed Wage Distribution by Team and League\", x = \"Team\", y = \"Average Wage (EUR)\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](Rplot.png)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe filtered analysis, focusing on specific teams within the top five leagues, underscores significant variability in player wages influenced by both the league and the team. These findings assist in understanding how different football economies operate within the realm of FIFA 22.\n\n### **Implications**\n\n-   **Player Negotiations**: This knowledge is crucial for players negotiating contracts in career mode.\n\n-   **Team Financial Strategy**: Helps team managers in FIFA 22 plan financially, considering the typical wage structures of their league and competitors.\n",
