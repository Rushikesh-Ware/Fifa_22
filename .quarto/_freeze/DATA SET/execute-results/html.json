To prepare the data for analysis, it was first loaded into a data frame for easier handling and manipulation.\n\nKey preprocessing steps included:\n\n-   **Organizing Player Positions**: Players were grouped into broader categories such as forwards, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers to facilitate comparative analysis across different playing roles.\n\n-   **Segmenting by Age**: Players were classified into age groups (e.g., Young, Prime, Mature, Veteran) to analyze trends and performances based on their career stage.\n\n-   **Enhancing Data Readability**: The arrangement of the dataset was refined by grouping similar types of information together, making the data easier to navigate and analyze\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # Install and load the dplyr library\n    library(dplyr)\n    \n    Fifa_22 = read.csv(\"players_22.csv\")\n    \n    # Check for unique values in player_position to understand what's there\n    unique(Fifa_22$player_positions)\n    \n    \n    # Recategorize player positions\n    Fifa_22 <- Fifa_22 %>%\n      mutate(grouped_position = case_when(\n        player_positions %in% c(\"ST\", \"LW\", \"RW\", \"CF\") ~ \"Forward\",\n        player_positions %in% c(\"CM\", \"CDM\", \"CAM\", \"RM\", \"LM\") ~ \"Midfield\",\n        player_positions %in% c(\"CB\", \"LB\", \"RB\", \"LWB\", \"RWB\") ~ \"Defense\",\n        TRUE ~ \"Other\"  # This catches any positions not listed above\n      ))\n    \n    \n    Fifa_22$player_positions <- toupper(Fifa_22$player_positions)\n    \n    # Recategorize player positions using nested ifelse\n    Fifa_22$grouped_position <- ifelse(Fifa_22$player_positions == \"GK\", \"Goalkeeper\",\n                                       ifelse(Fifa_22$player_positions %in% c(\"ST\", \"LW\", \"RW\", \"CF\"), \"Forward\",\n                                              ifelse(Fifa_22$player_positions %in% c(\"CM\", \"CDM\", \"CAM\", \"RM\", \"LM\"), \"Midfield\",\n                                                     ifelse(Fifa_22$player_positions %in% c(\"CB\", \"LB\", \"RB\", \"LWB\", \"RWB\"), \"Defense\", \"Other\"))))\n    \n    Fifa_22 <- Fifa_22 %>%\n      mutate(grouped_position = case_when(\n        grepl(\"ST|LW|RW|CF\", toupper(player_positions)) ~ \"Forward\",\n        grepl(\"CM|CDM|CAM|RM|LM\", toupper(player_positions)) ~ \"Midfield\",\n        grepl(\"CB|LB|RB|LWB|RWB\", toupper(player_positions)) ~ \"Defense\",\n        toupper(player_positions) == \"GK\" ~ \"Goalkeeper\",\n        TRUE ~ \"Other\"\n      ))\n    \n    Fifa_22 <- Fifa_22 %>%\n      select(1:(which(names(Fifa_22) == \"player_positions\")),  # Select all columns up to 'player_position'\n             grouped_position,                               # Include 'grouped_position' right after\n             everything()) \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    # Assuming 'players' is your dataframe and it contains an 'age' column\n    Fifa_22 <- Fifa_22 %>%\n      mutate(age_group = case_when(\n        age >= 16 & age <= 21 ~ \"Young\",\n        age > 21 & age <= 28 ~ \"Prime\",\n        age > 28 & age <= 34 ~ \"Mature\",\n        age > 34 ~ \"Veteran\",\n        TRUE ~ \"Unspecified\"  # Catch-all for any data that might not fit the above categories\n      ))\n    \n    # Reorder columns to place 'age_group' next to 'age'\n    Fifa_22 <- Fifa_22 %>%\n      select(1:(which(names(Fifa_22) == \"age\")),  # Select all columns up to 'age'\n             age_group,                          # Include 'age_group' right after 'age'\n             everything())                        # Then include all the remaining columns\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    .\n\nThese steps ensured that the dataset was well-organized and primed for the detailed analysis that followed, focusing on how player attributes influence their market value, ratings, and wages in the game.\n\n**Output:**\n\n![](images/clipboard-2565916960.png)\n\n### References :\n\nDataset: Fifa 22 <https://sports-statistics.com/sports-data/fifa-2022-dataset-csvs/>\n",
