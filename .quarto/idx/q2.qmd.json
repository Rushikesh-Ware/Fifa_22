Chi-squared tests were conducted to determine if there were significant differences in the distribution of ratings across these groups. Additionally, box plots were utilized to visually compare the overall ratings across different age groups and positions.\n\n### **Statistical Analysis**\n\n#### **Chi-Squared Test Results**\n\nThe Chi-squared test indicated a highly significant association between players' positions, age groups, and their ratings, with a p-value less than 2.2e-16, suggesting strong dependency.\n\n```{r .fold, eval=FALSE}\ncontingency_table <- table(players_clean$grouped_position, players_clean$age_group)\n\n# Chi-square test of independence\nchi_test_result <- chisq.test(contingency_table)\nprint(chi_test_result)\n\n\n# Assuming chi_test_result is your chi-square test result\nstd_res <- chisq.test(contingency_table)$stdres\n# View standardized residuals\nprint(std_res)\n\n```\n\n#### **Distribution of Overall Ratings by Age Group**\n\nThe box plot for overall ratings by age group illustrates that players in the 'Prime' and 'Veteran' groups tend to have higher median ratings, indicating peak performance during these stages.\n\n```{r .fold1, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(Fifa_22, aes(x = age_group, y = overall, fill = age_group)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Overall Ratings by Age Group\")\n\n```\n\n![](by%20age%20group.png)\n\n#### **Distribution of Overall Ratings by Position**\n\nThe box plot across positions shows variability in ratings, with goalkeepers and forwards generally having higher ratings, suggesting positional impacts on player evaluations.\n\n```{r .fold2, eval=FALSE}\nggplot(Fifa_22, aes(x = grouped_position, y = overall, fill = grouped_position)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Overall Ratings by Position\")\n\n```\n\n![](overall%20by%20position.png)\n\n### **Detailed Interaction Analysis**\n\nFurther analysis using interaction plots revealed specific trends between different age groups and positions.
