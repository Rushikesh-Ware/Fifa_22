This selection was intended to balance the analysis across historically successful clubs and other significant but perhaps less dominant teams, providing a broader perspective on wage distribution across different levels of club success and popularity.\n\n```{r .fold, eval=FALSE}\ntop_leagues_players <- Fifa_22 %>%\n  filter(league_name %in% c(\"English Premier League\", \"Spain Primera Division\", \n                            \"German 1.

Key results include:\n\n-   **League Contributions**: Different leagues have different base salary levels, with coefficients indicating how much above or below the average league wage each league tends to pay.\n\n-   **Club Contributions**: Clubs also show significant variability, with some paying substantially more or less than the league average, reflecting their financial strategies and market positioning.\n\n#### **Visual Analysis of Wage Distribution**\n\n##### **Average Salary by Team and League**\n\nThis visualization reflects the average salary distribution by team within each selected league, illustrating the diversity of wage scales:\n\n```{r .fold3, eval=FALSE}\nggplot(average_salary_per_team, aes(x = reorder(club_name, -average_wage), y = average_wage, fill = league_name)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary by Team and League\", x = \"Team\", y = \"Average Salary (EUR)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n```\n\n![](avg salary.png)\n\n##### **Detailed Wage Distribution by Team and League**\n\nFurther detailed analysis of wage distribution by team and league highlights the spread and outliers, providing deeper insights into each teamâ€™s wage policy:\n\n```{r .fold4, eval=FALSE}\n\nggplot(average_salary_per_team, aes(x = club_name, y = average_wage, fill = league_name)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = average_wage - wage_sd, ymax = average_wage + wage_sd), width = 0.4) +\n  coord_flip() +  # Flips the axes for better visualization of team names\n  labs(title = \"Detailed Wage Distribution by Team and League\", x = \"Team\", y = \"Average Wage (EUR)\")\n\n\n```\n\n![](Rplot.png)\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe filtered analysis, focusing on specific teams within the top five leagues, underscores significant variability in player wages influenced by both the league and the team.
