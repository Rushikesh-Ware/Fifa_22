The world of virtual football in EA Sports FIFA 22 offers a rich dataset for analyzing and understanding real-world football dynamics through the lens of a globally popular video game. This project aims to dissect the interplay between various player attributes and their market value, how age and playing position influence player ratings, and the impact of league affiliations and team dynamics on player wages.

By leveraging the comprehensive data available in FIFA 22, this study provides insights into the factors that drive player evaluations in the game, which can be reflective of broader trends in the world of professional football. Through a series of statistical analyses, this report addresses three primary research questions:

-   What is the relationship between player attributes such as skill, stamina, and performance metrics with their market value?

-   How do age and playing position affect a player’s potential and overall ratings, and what patterns can be discerned from this analysis?

-   Does a player’s wage correlate with the league they are part of and the specific team they play for, and what implications does this have for game strategy and team management?

This exploration not only enriches our understanding of game mechanics but also provides a proxy for real-life football analytics, making this study relevant for both gamers and football analysts alike. Through this report, we aim to uncover underlying patterns that define player valuation and performance in FIFA 22, offering valuable insights for players, game developers, and sports analysts.
